        "In India, Animals dont get medical insurance like us humans. However, when our pets fall ill and require immediate medical care, our savings are not enough to cover the expensive surgery and treatment costs. By starting an Animal Crowdfunding, pet owners can receive small contributions from a large group of people and ensure their pets get the needed medical care.",

      description:
        "Most animal shelters require constant financial help to provide food and primary healthcare facilities. However, the number of individuals volunteering at shelters is very low. Hence, they have to dedicate every moment to caring for the animals. Starting an animal crowdfunding campaign to support the animal shelter allows them to use social media and the power of the internet to raise awareness and get funding.",

      description:
        "Saving abandoned animals, rescuing injured and helpless animals require different types of equipment. Similarly, providing these animals with a haven and treating their injuries is expensive. Rehabilitation is costly, and the groups that conduct such activities are very few. Therefore, we urge rescue groups to start a crowdfunding campaign for animals on Ketto to ensure all their expenses can be taken care of through fundraising online for such causes.",
